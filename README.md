I completed COMP 218 - Fundamentals of programming at Concoria University. 

It was required of us to create this program from scratch as an assignment.

The purpose of this program was to analyse the performance of students based on a user-defined
threshold.

This assignment required a good understanding of loops, reading/writing to a file and writing Functions.
